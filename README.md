##  Project Overview

Modern medical imaging—particularly MRI scans—plays a vital role in diagnosing brain tumors. In this project, I developed a CNN-based system to:

1. Preprocess MRI images using OpenCV (e.g., resizing, normalization).
2. Train and evaluate a model using TensorFlow and Keras for tumor prediction.
3. Deliver accurate and timely tumor detection to enhance diagnostic workflows.
